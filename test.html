                LONDON — For Prime Minister Liz Truss, it was a chance to
                steady the waters after days of turmoil in the financial
                markets over her new fiscal plan: eight rapid-fire interviews
                with local BBC radio stations from Leeds to Nottingham.
                By the time Ms. Truss signed off from the last one on Thursday
                morning, her political woes had multiplied, leaving her new
                government in a state of disarray almost without precedent in
                recent British politics.<br>
                <br>
                She was, critics said, robotic in defending a tax-cut plan
                that had been eviscerated by the markets, and showed little
                sympathy for the pain that high interest rates could inflict
                on mortgage holders. One host described her as a “reverse
                Robin Hood.” A listener on another station asked, “Are you
                ashamed of what you’ve done?”<br>
                <br>
                Barely three weeks into her job, Ms. Truss has suffered a
                dizzying loss of public support. Her Conservative Party now
                trails the opposition Labour Party by 33 percentage points,
                according to a new poll by the market research firm YouGov.
                That is the largest Labour lead since Tony Blair’s early days
                as prime minister in 1998, and the kind of gap that usually
                results in a landslide election defeat.<br>

                Her plunging poll numbers have badly damaged Ms. Truss’s standing in her party, which is gathering on Sunday in Birmingham for what promises to be an anxious annual conference. Some speak openly of the party ousting her before the next election, though the mechanics for doing that remain complicated.

                “This is by far the biggest and swiftest hit to a party’s opinion poll rating that British politics has ever seen,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “For Tory MPs, this is like realizing on your wedding night that you’ve made a truly terrible mistake.”

                Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at Kent University and an expert on the Tory Party, said, “I can’t think in my lifetime of any British prime minister who has mismanaged her first few weeks in office like Liz Truss.”
